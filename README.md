# Enterprise Social Network (Decentralized on Nostr)

## 🌐 Overview

**Enterprise Social Network (ESN)** is a long-term project to build a decentralized, secure, and privacy-first communication and collaboration platform for organizations — powered by the Nostr protocol.

This platform aims to provide an alternative to centralized enterprise software by leveraging decentralized technologies to ensure ownership, transparency, and data sovereignty.

ESN integrates core enterprise functions such as **ERP**, **CRM**, **Personal Finance**, and **Journaling** — enabling teams and individuals to operate freely and securely without vendor lock-in.
